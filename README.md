## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [UUID]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)) - For unique ID
- [react-beautiful-dnd]((https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)) - For drag and drop functionality

### What I learned

The Todo App was a good challenge in which I learn more about how to work with the useState Hook and the use-local-storage
uuidv4 was very helpful to create unique id's


### Continued development

The drag and drop option is still pending as I'm still working on understandding how make it work but will keep it updated.

### Useful resources

- [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - To create unique ID's (uuid.v4()). Create a version 4 (random) UUID.
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - Very useful to add drag and drop functionality.
